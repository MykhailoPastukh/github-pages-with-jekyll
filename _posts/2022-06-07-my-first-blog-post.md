## List patterns ##
List patterns extend pattern matching to match sequences of elements in a list or an array. 
For example, sequence is `[1, 2, 3]` is `true` when the sequence is an array or a list of three integers (1, 2, and 3). 
You can match elements using any pattern, including constant, type, property and relational patterns. 
The discard pattern (`_`) matches any single element, and the new range pattern (`..`) matches any sequence of zero or more elements.
